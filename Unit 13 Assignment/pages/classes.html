            <h2>Karate</h2>
            <p>Karate is a martial art that originated in the Ryukyu Kingdom (modern-day Okinawa, Japan). It focuses on striking techniques, including punches, kicks, knee strikes, elbow strikes, and open-hand techniques like knife-hands. Karate practitioners, known as karateka, train in forms (kata), sparring (kumite), and fundamental techniques (kihon) to develop precision, power, and discipline. 

The word "karate" translates to "empty hand" in Japanese, reflecting its emphasis on unarmed combat. Over time, karate evolved into various styles, each with unique approaches to movement, philosophy, and training methods. </p>

            <h2>Judo</h2>
            <p>Judo is a Japanese martial art and Olympic sport that focuses on grappling, throws, and submissions. It was founded in 1882 by Kanō Jigorō, who adapted techniques from traditional jiu-jitsu to create a system emphasizing maximum efficiency and mutual respect. 

The word "judo" translates to "gentle way", reflecting its philosophy of using an opponent’s force against them rather than relying on brute strength. In competition, the goal is to throw, pin, or submit an opponent using joint locks or chokeholds. </p>

            <h2>Muay Thai</h2>
            <p>Muay Thai, also known as Thai boxing, is a martial art and combat sport from Thailand that emphasizes stand-up striking and clinching techniques. It is often called the "Art of Eight Limbs" because fighters use their fists, elbows, knees, and shins to attack and defend. 

Muay Thai has deep cultural roots in Thailand, dating back centuries, and was originally developed for military combat before evolving into a competitive sport. Today, it is practiced worldwide and is a key component of mixed martial arts (MMA) due to its powerful striking techniques and effective close-range combat. </p>

            <h2>Jiu-jitsu</h2>
            <p>Jiu-jitsu (or jujutsu) is a Japanese martial art that focuses on grappling and close combat techniques. It emphasizes using an opponent's force against them rather than relying on brute strength. The term "jiu-jitsu" comes from the Japanese words "jū" (gentle) and "jutsu" (art or technique), meaning "gentle art". 

Jiu-jitsu includes throws, joint locks, pins, and submissions, making it effective for self-defense and combat situations. Over time, different variations have emerged, including Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu (BJJ), which focuses on ground fighting and submission holds.
